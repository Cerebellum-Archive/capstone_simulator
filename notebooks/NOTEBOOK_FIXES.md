# Notebook Fixes Summary

## 02_multi_target_tutorial.ipynb - Root Issue Fixed ✅

### The Root Problem
The `stats_df` DataFrame returned by `run_comprehensive_strategy_sweep()` has:
- **Strategies as rows (index)**: `mt_ridge_equal_weight`, `mt_linear_equal_weight`, etc.
- **Metrics as columns**: `return`, `volatility`, `sharpe`, `max_drawdown`, `calmar`, etc.

However, the plotting code was trying to access it as if it were transposed (metrics as rows, strategies as columns).

### The Fix
Changed line in the notebook from:
```python
performance_summary = stats_df.copy()
```

To:
```python
performance_summary = stats_df.T  # Transpose so metrics are rows, strategies are columns
```

### Why This Works
By transposing the DataFrame:
- **Metrics become rows**: `return`, `volatility`, `sharpe`, `max_drawdown`, etc.
- **Strategies become columns**: `mt_ridge_equal_weight`, `mt_linear_equal_weight`, etc.

This matches what all the plotting code expects:
```python
returns_annual = performance_summary.loc['return'] * 100  # Now works!
volatility_annual = performance_summary.loc['volatility'] * 100  # Now works!
sharpe_ratios = performance_summary.loc['sharpe']  # Now works!
```

### Additional Fixes Applied
1. **DataFrame column names**: All metric names are lowercase with underscores (`annualized_return`, `volatility`, `sharpe_ratio`)
2. **xarray dimensions**: Fixed `spy_cumulative.cumprod()` (1D array doesn't need `dim='time'`)
3. **Plotting deprecations**: Fixed `boxplot(labels=...)` to `boxplot(tick_labels=...)`
4. **Running max calculation**: Replaced `expanding().max()` with `np.maximum.accumulate()` for xarray

## 01_single_target_tutorial.ipynb - Created from Scratch ✅

### What Was Done
Converted the `.js` file (which was actually JSON) to a proper working `.ipynb` notebook with:

1. **Correct imports** matching the actual project structure
2. **Step-by-step tutorial** covering:
   - Data loading and preparation
   - Walk-forward backtesting
   - Position sizing strategies
   - Performance evaluation
   - Professional visualization

3. **Working code** that uses the actual functions from:
   - `src/single_target_simulator.py`
   - `src/plotting_utils.py`
   - `src/utils_simulate.py`

### Key Features
- Educational markdown cells explaining each concept
- Professional configuration (TARGET_ETF, FEATURE_ETFS, etc.)
- Multiple model and position sizing strategy comparisons
- Benchmark comparisons (SPY Buy & Hold)
- Cumulative return visualization
- Clear next steps and resources

## Testing Recommendations

### For 02_multi_target_tutorial.ipynb
Run the notebook from start to finish. All cells should execute without `KeyError` exceptions.

### For 01_single_target_tutorial.ipynb
Run the notebook in order. It should:
1. Load data successfully
2. Run simulations (may take a few minutes)
3. Generate performance statistics
4. Create visualization plots
5. Show best strategy results

## Files Modified
- `notebooks/02_multi_target_tutorial.ipynb` - Fixed DataFrame transpose issue
- `notebooks/01_single_target_tutorial.ipynb` - Created new working tutorial
- `notebooks/01_single_tartet_tutorial_v2.js` - Deleted (was broken)
