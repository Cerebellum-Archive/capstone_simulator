### üîß Code Contributions

#### Before You Start
- **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
- **Discuss major changes** by creating an issue first
- **Focus on educational value** - how does this help students learn?

#### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards:
   - Add comprehensive docstrings with educational context
   - Include type hints where appropriate
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add unit tests for new functionality

3. **Write tests**:
   ```bash
   # Add tests in the appropriate test file
   tests/test_your_module.py
   
   # Run tests to ensure they pass
   pytest tests/test_your_module.py -v
   ```

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Add docstrings explaining the educational purpose
   - Include examples in docstrings

5. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of your change"
   ```

6. **Push and create Pull Request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìã Coding Standards

### Code Style
- **Follow PEP 8** for Python code style
- **Use meaningful variable names** that are self-documenting
- **Add type hints** for function parameters and return values
- **Keep functions focused** - one responsibility per function

### Documentation Standards
- **Educational docstrings**: Explain not just what, but why and how it relates to quantitative finance
- **Include examples**: Show practical usage in docstrings
- **Educational notes**: Add "Educational Note:" sections explaining financial concepts
- **Clear error messages**: Help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it

### Example of Good Docstring:
```python
def calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns: pd.Series, risk_free_rate: float = 0.0) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the Sharpe ratio for a return series.
    
    The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted performance by dividing excess returns
    by volatility. It's one of the most important metrics in quantitative finance.
    
    Educational Note:
        A Sharpe ratio > 1.0 is generally considered good, > 2.0 is excellent.
        The ratio helps compare strategies with different risk profiles.
    
    Args:
        returns: Daily return series
        risk_free_rate: Annual risk-free rate (default: 0.0)
        
    Returns:
        Annualized Sharpe ratio
        
    Example:
        >>> returns = pd.Series([0.01, -0.005, 0.02, -0.01])
        >>> sharpe = calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns)
        >>> print(f"Sharpe ratio: {sharpe:.2f}")
    """
```

### Testing Standards
- **Write unit tests** for all new functions
- **Include edge cases** (empty data, NaN values, extreme values)
- **Test error handling** - ensure functions fail gracefully
- **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested

## üéì Educational Contribution Guidelines

### What We're Looking For
- **Clear explanations**: Help students understand complex concepts
- **Practical examples**: Real-world applications of quantitative methods
- **Interactive content**: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step walkthroughs

- **Career guidance**: Insights into quantitative finance careers

### Educational Standards
- **Assume basic knowledge**: Target upper-level undergraduate/graduate students
