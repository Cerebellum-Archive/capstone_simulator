## üß† Model Complexity Scoring & Overfitting Detection

The framework includes sophisticated **model complexity analysis** to help identify and mitigate overfitting risks‚Äîa critical concern in quantitative finance where complex models may capture noise rather than genuine market signals.

### Key Features

- **üéØ Automated Complexity Scoring**: Each model receives a complexity score based on its architecture and hyperparameters
- **üìä Complexity-Adjusted Metrics**: Performance metrics adjusted for model complexity to identify truly robust strategies
- **‚öñÔ∏è Overfitting Risk Assessment**: Early warning system for models that may not generalize well
- **üîç Meta-Analysis Tools**: Compare strategies with similar complexity scores for fair evaluation

### Complexity Score Examples

```python
from capstone_simulator import get_complexity_score, calculate_complexity_adjusted_metrics

# Simple models (lower scores = less overfitting risk)
ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)          # Score: ~0.5
ols_model = LinearRegression()          # Score: 1.0 (baseline)

# Complex models (higher scores = higher overfitting risk) 
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor()      # Score: ~11.0
xgb_model = XGBRegressor()             # Score: ~2.3

# Hyperparameter search amplifies complexity
grid_search = GridSearchCV(rf_model, param_grid) # Score: ~50+ (depending on search space)

# Calculate complexity-adjusted performance metrics
returns = your_strategy_returns
complexity_metrics = calculate_complexity_adjusted_metrics(returns, complexity_score)

print(f"Raw Sharpe Ratio: {metrics['sharpe_ratio']:.2f}")
print(f"Complexity-Adjusted Sharpe: {complexity_metrics['complexity_adjusted_sharpe']:.2f}")
print(f"Overfitting Risk Score: {complexity_metrics['overfitting_penalty']:.2f}")
```

### Educational Value

Understanding model complexity teaches crucial quantitative finance concepts:

- **üéì Bias-Variance Trade-off**: Balance between model flexibility and generalization
- **üî¨ Out-of-Sample Robustness**: Why simpler models often perform better in production
- **üìà Production Deployment**: How complexity affects real-world trading performance
- **‚ö° Risk Management**: Early detection of potentially unreliable signals

The complexity scoring system integrates seamlessly with the framework's metadata system, automatically calculating scores based on simulation configurations stored in the reproducible hash system.

## Example Workflow (Full Research Cycle)

```python
# 1. INPUTS: Load ETF data via yfinance
import yfinance as yf
data = yf.download(['SPY', 'XLK', 'XLF'], start='2020-01-01')

# 2. PREPROCESSING: Feature engineering with xarray
from src.utils_simulate import EWMTransformer, create_results_xarray
transformer = EWMTransformer(halflife=5)
features_smooth = transformer.fit_transform(features)

# 3. EXPLORATION: Analyze feature importance
from src.utils_simulate import p_by_year
feat_analysis = p_by_year(X_features, y_target)

# 4. SIMULATION: Walk-forward backtesting
results = simulate_strategy(features_smooth, targets, model='ridge')

# 5. REPORTING: Generate publication-quality outputs
results_xr = create_results_xarray(results)
results_xr.plot.line(x='time', col='strategy', col_wrap=2)
```

See `notebooks/03_full_research_cycle.ipynb` for a complete implementation.

## üïê Tutorial: Hash-Based Future Testing

This tutorial demonstrates the **killer feature** of the framework: running your exact historical strategy on future data to test true out-of-sample performance.

### Step-by-Step: Today's Strategy, Tomorrow's Data

#### Phase 1: Run Initial Strategy (January 2025)
```python
# Run your strategy on historical data (2020-2024)
from src.multi_target_simulator import run_simulation

results = run_simulation(
    target_etfs=['SPY', 'QQQ', 'IWM'],
    feature_etfs=['XLK', 'XLF', 'XLV', 'XLY', 'XLP'],
    model='RandomForestRegressor',
    params={'n_estimators': 100, 'max_depth': 5},
    training_window_size=400,
    position_sizer='confidence_weighted',
    start_date='2020-01-01',
    end_date='2024-12-31'
)

# Note the hash for future use
strategy_hash = results['simulation_hash']
print(f"Strategy Hash: {strategy_hash}")
print(f"Trained on: 2020-2024")
print(f"In-Sample Sharpe: {results['sharpe_ratio']:.2f}")

# Hash stored automatically: cache/simulation_{hash}_multi_target.zarr
```

#### Phase 2: Wait for New Data (June 2025)
```python
# 6 months later... new market data is available
# Your strategy parameters are perfectly preserved in the hash

from src.multi_target_simulator import reconstruct_pipeline_from_metadata, run_reconstructed_pipeline

# Reconstruct EXACT same pipeline from hash
pipeline_config = reconstruct_pipeline_from_metadata(
    simulation_hash=strategy_hash,  # From January
    tag='multi_target'
)

print("Reconstructed Strategy:")
print(f"Model: {pipeline_config['model']}")
print(f"Parameters: {pipeline_config['params']}")
print(f"Training Window: {pipeline_config['training_window_size']}")
print(f"Original Born Date: {pipeline_config['born_on_date']}")
```

#### Phase 3: Test on Truly Unseen Data
```python
# Download completely new data (2025 Q1-Q2)
from src.utils_simulate import download_etf_data, prepare_features_targets

new_data = download_etf_data(
    tickers=['SPY', 'QQQ', 'IWM', 'XLK', 'XLF', 'XLV', 'XLY', 'XLP'],
    start_date='2025-01-01',  # Data the model has NEVER seen
    end_date='2025-06-30'
)

X_new, y_new = prepare_features_targets(new_data, pipeline_config)

# Run EXACT same strategy on new data
oos_results = run_reconstructed_pipeline(pipeline_config, X_new, y_new)

print("\n=== OUT-OF-SAMPLE RESULTS ===")
print(f"Original Sharpe (2020-2024): {results['sharpe_ratio']:.2f}")
print(f"Out-of-Sample Sharpe (2025): {oos_results['sharpe_ratio']:.2f}")
print(f"Strategy Robustness: {oos_results['sharpe_ratio']/results['sharpe_ratio']:.1%}")

# If robustness > 80%, strategy shows genuine alpha
# If robustness < 50%, likely overfitted to historical data
```

#### Phase 4: Generate Comparative Report
```python
# Create side-by-side performance analysis
from src.plotting_utils import create_performance_tearsheet

# Generate report showing in-sample vs out-of-sample
create_performance_tearsheet(
    in_sample_results=results,
    out_of_sample_results=oos_results,
    strategy_hash=strategy_hash,
    title="Strategy Robustness Analysis: Jan 2025 vs Jun 2025"
)

# PDF report includes:
# - Vertical line at born_on_date (when strategy was created)
# - Cumulative returns showing strategy decay/persistence
# - Risk metrics comparison (Sharpe, Calmar, Max Drawdown)
# - Statistical significance tests
```

### Real-World Applications

**üéì Academic Research**: 
```python
# Thesis defense: "I trained this strategy in January, here's how it performed 
# on unseen March data with no modifications"
```

**üèõÔ∏è Institutional Validation**: 
```python
# Hedge fund presentation: "Our model shows 85% robustness over 6-month 
# out-of-sample period, indicating genuine alpha discovery"
```

**üìä Strategy Monitoring**:
```python
# Monthly strategy review: Compare current performance against 
# original hash to detect strategy decay
```

### Advanced Hash Management

```python
# List all historical strategies
from src.multi_target_simulator import list_cached_simulations

strategies = list_cached_simulations()
for hash_id, metadata in strategies.items():
    print(f"Hash: {hash_id}")
    print(f"Created: {metadata['born_on_date']}")
    print(f"Model: {metadata['model']}")
    print(f"Performance: {metadata.get('sharpe_ratio', 'N/A')}")
    print("---")

# Clean up old experiments
cleanup_old_hashes(older_than_days=90)
```

This workflow represents **institutional-grade strategy validation** - the same process used by quantitative hedge funds to distinguish genuine alpha from statistical noise.

## üíæ Modern Hash Storage & Out-of-Sample Testing

The framework uses **xarray.zarr format** for intelligent caching and complete reproducibility. Every simulation generates a unique hash based on all parameters (data sources, model configuration, training windows, etc.) and stores both results and complete metadata for future reconstruction.

### Zarr-Based Hash Storage System

```python
# Automatic hash generation and storage
from src.multi_target_simulator import run_simulation

# Run initial simulation (automatically cached)
results = run_simulation(
    target_etfs=['SPY', 'QQQ'], 
    model='RandomForestRegressor',
    params={'n_estimators': 100},
    training_window_size=400
)

# Hash automatically generated: simulation_a1b2c3d4_multi_target.zarr
print(f"Simulation hash: {results['simulation_hash']}")
```

### True Out-of-Sample Testing

The revolutionary feature is **pipeline reconstruction from hash files** - allowing you to test how your **exact same strategy** performs on completely new, unseen data:

```python
from src.multi_target_simulator import reconstruct_pipeline_from_metadata, run_reconstructed_pipeline

# 1. Reconstruct the EXACT pipeline from hash
pipeline_config = reconstruct_pipeline_from_metadata(
    simulation_hash='a1b2c3d4',  # From your original run
    tag='multi_target'
)

# 2. Test on completely new data (e.g., 2025 data when original was 2020-2024)
new_data = download_etf_data(['SPY', 'QQQ'], start_date='2025-01-01')
X_new, y_new = prepare_features_targets(new_data)

# 3. Run EXACT same strategy on new data
oos_results = run_reconstructed_pipeline(pipeline_config, X_new, y_new)

# 4. Compare performance: original vs out-of-sample
print(f"Original Sharpe: {original_sharpe:.2f}")
print(f"Out-of-Sample Sharpe: {oos_sharpe:.2f}")
print(f"Strategy robustness: {oos_sharpe/original_sharpe:.1%}")
```

### Complete Metadata Preservation

Each zarr file contains **everything needed** for perfect reproduction:

```python
# Load any historical simulation
results_df, metadata = load_simulation_results('a1b2c3d4', 'multi_target')

print(metadata['born_on_date'])        # '2025-01-15T10:30:45'
print(metadata['target_etfs'])         # ['SPY', 'QQQ']
print(metadata['model_pipeline'])      # 'Pipeline([('ewm', EWMTransformer(halflife=5)), ...]'
print(metadata['training_window'])     # 400
print(metadata['data_fingerprint'])    # Hash of exact data used
print(metadata['framework_version'])   # '2.1.0'
```

### Easy Born-on-Date Access

The `born_on_date` is now stored as an **xarray coordinate** for lightning-fast access:

```python
# Quick access without loading full metadata
from src.multi_target_simulator import get_born_on_date_from_zarr
born_date = get_born_on_date_from_zarr('a1b2c3d4', 'multi_target')
print(f"Strategy created: {born_date}")  # '2025-01-15T10:30:45'

# Direct xarray coordinate access
import xarray as xr
ds = xr.open_zarr('cache/simulation_a1b2c3d4_multi_target.zarr')
print(f"Born on: {ds.coords['born_on_date'].values}")  # Ultra-fast!

# Perfect for filtering or plotting
strategies_by_date = {
    hash_id: str(ds.coords['born_on_date'].values) 
    for hash_id in strategy_hashes
}
```

### Institutional-Grade Benefits

This approach mirrors **hedge fund practices** where strategies must prove robustness across time periods:

- **üéØ Overfitting Detection**: Compare in-sample vs out-of-sample performance
- **üìä Strategy Decay Analysis**: Track how performance changes over time
- **üîÑ Reproducible Research**: Share exact configurations with colleagues
- **üèõÔ∏è Regulatory Compliance**: Complete audit trail for institutional use
- **üìà Production Deployment**: Test strategies before live trading

## üåê Intelligent yfinance Caching System

The framework includes a comprehensive **yfinance caching system** using zarr format to eliminate API rate limiting issues during development and research. This system automatically caches all ETF downloads, dramatically improving workflow efficiency.

### Automatic Cache Management

```python
from src.multi_target_simulator import download_etf_data_with_cache

# Automatic caching with configurable age limits
data = download_etf_data_with_cache(
    tickers=['SPY', 'QQQ', 'IWM'],
    start_date='2020-01-01',
    max_age_hours=24  # Refresh cache after 24 hours
)

# First run: Downloads from yfinance and caches
# Subsequent runs: Uses cached data (lightning fast!)
```

### Cache Benefits & Features

**üöÄ Performance Improvements:**
- **Instant Re-runs**: Cached data loads in milliseconds vs minutes for downloads
- **API Limit Protection**: Eliminates "ETF not found, using zeros" warnings
- **Offline Development**: Work without internet once data is cached
- **Batch Processing**: Run multiple simulations without API restrictions

**üíæ Smart Storage:**
```python
# Cache files stored in: cache/yfinance_data/
# Example: yf_SPY_QQQ_IWM_2020-01-01_2025-07-29.zarr

# Cache management utilities
from src.multi_target_simulator import list_yfinance_cache, clean_yfinance_cache

# View all cached datasets
list_yfinance_cache()
# Output shows: tickers, date ranges, file sizes, ages

# Clean old cache files (saves disk space)
clean_yfinance_cache(max_age_days=7)  # Remove files older than 7 days
```

**üîß Technical Architecture:**
- **Multi-Ticker Support**: Handles both single and multi-asset downloads seamlessly
- **Column Structure Preservation**: Maintains proper yfinance MultiIndex format
- **Metadata Tracking**: Stores download timestamps, ticker lists, date ranges
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual ticker failures
- **Memory Efficient**: Zarr format with compression for large datasets

### Integration with Simulations

Both simulation engines automatically use the caching system:

```python
# Single-target simulator with caching
from src.single_target_simulator import load_and_prepare_data
X, y = load_and_prepare_data(['SPY', 'QQQ'], target_etf='SPY', start_date='2020-01-01')
# Uses cached data if available, downloads if needed

# Multi-target simulator with caching  
from src.multi_target_simulator import Simulate_MultiTarget
results = Simulate_MultiTarget(
    target_etfs=['SPY', 'QQQ', 'IWM'],
    feature_etfs=['XLK', 'XLF', 'XLV'],
    start_date='2020-01-01'
)
# All ETF downloads automatically cached
```

### Real-World Workflow Benefits

**üéì Educational Use Cases:**
```python
# Students can experiment freely without API limits
for window_size in [200, 400, 600]:
    for model in ['ridge', 'rf', 'xgb']:
        results = run_simulation(window_size=window_size, model=model)
        # Each run reuses cached data - no download delays!
```

**üèõÔ∏è Research Applications:**
```python
# Researchers can iterate rapidly on strategy development
# Cache eliminates the "download bottleneck" in quantitative research
results_list = []
for strategy_config in strategy_grid:
    results = backtest_strategy(strategy_config)  # Instant data access
    results_list.append(results)
```

**‚ö° Production Benefits:**
- **Consistent Data**: Same cached dataset ensures reproducible results
- **Fast Prototyping**: Rapid strategy iteration without download delays  
- **Offline Capability**: Continue working during network outages
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces API usage for institutional subscriptions

## üî¨ Benefits of Enhanced Reproducibility

The expanded metadata hashing in the Capstone Simulator Framework ensures full reproducibility by storing all key parameters, such as data sources, training configurations, model pipelines, and simulation details. This structured approach, combined with the framework's comprehensive caching and metadata tracking, delivers significant benefits for quantitative trading research, particularly in addressing overfitting risks and fostering reliable alpha discovery.

### Key Benefits

#### **Mitigating Overfitting through a Reference Base**
By storing complete experiment configurations (e.g., ETF symbols, training windows, hyperparameters), the framework creates a robust reference base of all simulations. This allows researchers to systematically compare strategies across runs, identifying patterns that may indicate overfitting (e.g., strategies that perform well only on specific parameter sets). A comprehensive record of experiments helps distinguish true alpha‚Äîsignals with consistent predictive power‚Äîfrom spurious results driven by data-specific noise or over-optimized parameters.

#### **Enhanced Research Rigor**
Full reproducibility ensures every simulation can be recreated exactly, enabling researchers to validate results and build confidence in findings. The metadata (e.g., `random_seed=42`, `window_size=400`) acts as a blueprint, allowing users to revisit past experiments and assess their stability across different time periods or market conditions, reducing the risk of overfitting to a single dataset or period.

#### **Audit Trail for Transparency**
The detailed metadata structure supports regulatory compliance and academic scrutiny by providing a complete audit trail. This transparency is critical in financial research, where documenting the exact data (e.g., `start_date`, `feature_columns`) and model configurations (e.g., `pipe_steps`, `param_grid`) helps verify that performance metrics reflect genuine predictive power rather than overfitting artifacts.

#### **Facilitating Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**
Researchers and students can share exact simulation setups via metadata, fostering collaboration without ambiguity. This shared reference base allows teams to replicate experiments, refine strategies, and collectively evaluate whether discovered signals are robust or likely overfitted to historical data, accelerating the identification of true alpha.

#### **Version Control and Backward Compatibility**
Tracking `framework_version` and `python_version` ensures experiments remain reproducible even as the codebase evolves. This preserves the integrity of historical results, allowing users to compare new strategies against a baseline of past runs to assess whether improvements are genuine or artifacts of overfitting to new data or configurations.

#### **Educational Value for Understanding Alpha Discovery**
For students, the metadata-driven approach highlights the importance of reproducibility in financial modeling. By cataloging all experiments, it teaches the discipline of systematic testing, helping learners recognize overfitting pitfalls (e.g., cherry-picking parameters) and focus on strategies with repeatable performance, which are more likely to yield true alpha in live trading.

### Linking to Alpha Discovery

The reference base created by storing all experiments is a powerful tool for evaluating the likelihood of discovering true alpha. By maintaining a comprehensive record of simulations‚Äîincluding data fingerprints, model parameters, and performance metrics‚Äîresearchers can analyze the consistency of strategies across diverse conditions. Strategies that perform well across varied training windows, asset sets, or market regimes are less likely to be overfitted and more likely to capture genuine market inefficiencies. This systematic approach enables users to prioritize robust signals, filter out noise-driven results, and build confidence in strategies that hold up under scrutiny, ultimately increasing the probability of uncovering true alpha.
